            <h2>About the collection:</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="description">This collection spans 40+ years of action figure collectibles going back to the original Star Wars&trade; 
            through shows like The Walking Dead&trade; and Game of Thrones.&trade; I am a huge film and pop culture buff, <b>I remember going to see the first
                Star Wars movie in theaters in 1978</b>.  Since then I have enjoyed the genre of science fiction as well as cartoons and video games very much.
            These interests have served me well over the years as well as helping me build up a collection of action figures.  
            It is <i>unfortunate</i> that the current times have made it necessary to <em>liquidate my collection</em> in order to complete my education.  Along with these figures are ones from popular video games and movies.  Have a look and 
            see if there is something of interest to you.  Feel free to <a href="mailto: rbg11@psu.edu"><b>Send offer email.</b></a></p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for taking the time to look at what I am offering for sale.  I wish I did not have to part with them but due to rising tuition costs
                    this has become a necessity.  Hopefully one day after completing my education I can begin the quest to rebuild my collection.  When the time is right
                    I will make my collection even larger and more diverse.  Along with the current content I would like to add paraphernalia from most of the Star Trek series.
                    Thank you again for your time and I hope you can find something to add to your own collection.
